Here are few quick bullet points about me in no particular order:

* I'm a software engineer in northern VA. 
* In a past life I was a percussionist. I always thought I'd get back to it but I haven't played in quite a while. 
* From 2008 to 2012 I was a member of Toastmasters International. It helped me a lot in my public speaking and leadership skills and after a while I thought I'd never leave but again other piorities take over. 
* I am an avid amateur photographer. 
* I am passionate about the environment and clean energy. 

I'll be writing about any of my interests here. Maybe some of it will interest someone else as well.
