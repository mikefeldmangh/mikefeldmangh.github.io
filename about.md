I'm a software engineer in northern VA. In a past life I was a percussionist. I always thought I'd get back to it but I haven't played in quite a while. In 2008 I joined Toastmasters International. It helped me a lot in my public speaking and leadership skills and after a while I thought I'd never leave but again other piorities take over. I am an avid amateur photographer. I am also passionate about the environment and clean energy. I'll be writing about any of my interests here. Maybe some of it will interest someone else as well.
