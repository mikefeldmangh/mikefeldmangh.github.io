Here are few quick bullet points about me in no particular order:

* I'm a software engineer in northern VA. 
* In a past life I was a percussionist. I always thought I'd get back to it but I haven't played in quite a while. 
* From 2008 to 2012 I was a member of Toastmasters International. It helped me a lot in my public speaking and leadership skills and after a while I thought I'd never leave but again other piorities take over. 
* I am an avid amateur photographer. 
* I am passionate about the environment and clean energy. 

Most of the advice I have read about how to get more blog readers says to keep to one topic or theme in your blog. Well I'm throwing that out the window because I want to write about more than one thing. I'm not expecting to get a lot of readers anyway.

Many of my posts here will be my [lessons learned starting a business for my side project]({{ site.baseurl }}/Intro-To-Lessons/). But there will also be posts related to my other interests: photography, software and clean energy. Maybe some of it will interest someone else as well.
