title: From Canon To Fuji?

So there are tons of articles and stories like this online. I know because I read most of them before I switched. So why not add one more?

## My Canon ##

About five years ago my Dad gave me his old Canon Rebel EOS Xsi. It was my first digital SLR. I got a lot of use out of it. But this past year I had started thinking about getting a replacement. I could have stuck with that camera for a long time but it as really difficult to take decent shots indoors or in low light. I didn't want to lug around an external flash everywhere and I didn't even like using a flash that much. I needed a higher ISO which almost any of the more modern cameras would provide. I had always used Canon cameras so it made sense to stick with it since I was already used to them and I already had a couple decent lenses.

## Why the Switch? ##

I don't have a ton of money to spend on photography so I planned to stick near the lower end. I was looking at the Rebel T6s. It was relatively new and had a lot of the features of some of the higher end cameras. I looked at it and researched for a while as I usually do before a big purchase. And I started to read more that Canon had been falling behind in some areas.

About the same time I met some other photographers who were really liking their Fujifilm cameras. I didn't know much about the brand but I started doing my own research. Besides the quality of the photos, the first things that caught my attention were the manual control dials for everything, the consistently updated firmware, and the quality weather resistant construction. The more research I did, the more interested I became.

## Which Model? ##

Then I heard Fujifilm was going to announce the X-T2, the upgrade over the X-T1 I was looking at, and I should wait for that. The new improvements made me even more interested. But then the announcement came out. Umm...yes I would like all of those improvements. But...no, I could not afford that big price bump. I was hoping the X-T2 would be the same price as the X-T1 and the older model price would drop. At least the latter did happen. Of course as many people planned to move to the newer model, they would be selling their used X-T1 bodies. I could deal with a used X-T1 and get used to the changes from Canon, especially if I could save over $1000 compared to a new X-T2. That savings could pay for some lenses which I would need. In a couple years, maybe I could afford a new or used X-T2 if I still want it.

I was lucky enough to get a great used price on an X-T1 body and some accessories from a member of my photo club. Shortly after that I purchased the four lenses I decided I wanted:
* XF60mmF2.4 R Macro (used)
* XF18-135mmF3.5-5.6 R LM OIS WR
* XF35mmF2 R WR
* Samyang 12mm F2.0 NCS CS (used)

## How I Like It ##

I'm really happy with the new system. I find I'm using manual more with this camera compared to the Canon, perhaps because I don't have to remember which button to press.

A lot of people talk about how light the mirrorless Fuji is compared to what they had before. It is smaller. I suppose it's light. But compared to my Canon Rebel, it feels like it's about the same weight. The Canon probably has a lot of plastic in it so it wasn't that heavy to begin with. It is an entry level SLR. The Fujifilm definitely feels more solid.

I can finally use higher ISO without too much grain so I can take good photos indoors and in lower light.

There was only one thing that bugged me a little at first. I use a (Peak Design)[https://www.peakdesign.com/] Slide strap and Capture Clip. These use an ARCA-compatible tripod plate. But when screwed onto the bottom of the X-T1, it partially blocked the battery door. And with the way the mirrorless cameras drain batteries, I definitely want to be able to change the battery without removing the plate. Fortunately, when I purchased my used X-T1, it came with an L-bracket. The bracket has the hole more in the middle so when the plate is screwed into the bottom of it, the battery door opening is still clear. The bracket adds a little weight and size but I don't mind much. I leave it on almost all the time.

## Conclusion ##

I would definitely recommend the Fujifilm systems to anyone thinking about something new. Gear isn't the most important thing, but in this case it has helped me get some shots I wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
