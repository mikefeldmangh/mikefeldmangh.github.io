title: Trash to Treasure? Cheap Orange Flashlight

This is a post in a series related to [One Man's Trash...]({{ site.baseurl }}/One-Mans-Trash)

I had a cheap orange flashlight hanging on the wall in my basement for years. It was a gift. I kept it "just in case" I ever needed it. Recently my daughter had an overnight school trip. It was the perfect use for it. I sent a backup with her too. Good thing because the bulb in this one died sometime that night. It's debut performance and it was done. I did say it was cheap, right?

Regular incandescent bulb. I'm sure I could replace it but is there a point? If I was more of a DIYer, I might be able to find a way to put in an LED instead. But that seems like a lot of work. Sadly, this flashlight will probably meet the trash can and the landfill. But not before doing some modeling first.

I used my Fujifilm X-T1 and my XF60mmF2.4 R Macro lens which was feeling a little lonely and not getting enough use.

It was good practice. Interesting results. They aren't spectaclar, but not bad. We'll see what else I can find.
