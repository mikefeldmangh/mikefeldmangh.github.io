title: Trash to Treasure? Cree LED Bulbs

This is a post in a series related to [One Man's Trash...]({{ site.baseurl }}/One-Mans-Trash)

A few years ago in 2013, [Cree Lighting](http://lighting.cree.com/) came out with a 60 watt LED replacement bulb at a reasonable price. As far as I knew Cree was the leader in LED lighting and they had a good reputation. I bought a whole bunch of these bulbs over two or three purchases. These were mainly used in our bathrooms. I expected them to last at least 10 years.

A couple years later, the plastic globe part of one bulb separated from the bottom and fell down onto the bathroom counter. Fortunately it was plastic and not glass. Because of the lifetime warranty, I contacted Cree and then had the bulb replaced at Home Depot.

But then in 2016 I had more problems. Two of the bulbs would go out for some period of time and then come back. They might be out for a minute or a day. I contacted Cree again and they sent replacements. This time the bulbs were the next generation. Even Cree admitted there were problems with the first generation.

At this point, because more of them died, I have replaced all but 3 of the original 14 bulbs. I started replacing them with Philips LED bulbs since they are only $2 per bulb now. It's much easier to buy them than to contact Cree and wait for replacements.

Anyway, on to the photo shoot.

Another dead bulb also had the plastic globe become disconnected from the bottom like the first one. That's the one seen below. It was a lot more interesting to see the inside.

I shot these at the same time as the paints in [Plastic Model Finishing Kit]({{ site.baseurl }}/Plastic-Model-Finishing-Kit) so the set up is the same.

The plastic globes on these bulbs is a little rubbery so the dust was difficult to remove. 

I need to figure out a better diffuser for the light I'm using, especially with reflective items like this. I tried creating a diffuser with some of that translucent packing material that comes in sheets and taping it inside a picture frame. But it wasn't thick enough. You can also see the edges of the white styrofoam in the reflection in the plastic globes in some images.

Here are some more of the images.

I'm sure you are wondering why I still have these. I know I could put these in the trash. I'm wondering if electronics recyclers will take them. I also saw an article where someone [repurposed LEDs](https://hackaday.com/2017/12/19/resurrecting-dead-led-lightbulbs/) into a new light after the driver failed. Someone might be able to do something with these although it could be difficult. Probably better to recycle them. Let me know if you have any ideas.
