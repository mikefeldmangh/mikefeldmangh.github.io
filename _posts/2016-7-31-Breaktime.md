title: Break Time!
category: side

It's actually been break time for a while, for my side project that is. I haven't made much progress on it in a long time. I still think it's a worthwhile project. But I only have so much free time outside of the regular day job. It became a little too difficult to work on without any help. Maybe I will get back to it sometime. But for now I realize I only have time for one personal free-time activity so I've been doing more photography. I enjoy it more and there is less stress. So you will probably see more posts here in other categories in the future.
