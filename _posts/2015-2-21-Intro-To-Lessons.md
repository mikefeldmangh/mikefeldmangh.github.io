title: Side Project Lessons Learned
---

I've been a software developer for more than 17 years. Most of that has been with Java. About three years ago I had an idea for a web application. I have been working on it in whatever free time I have. To make it a little more interesting, I decided to use Ruby on Rails for the application. So I had to learn that at the same time. Over the last few weeks I slowly launched [Issue Loop](http://www.issueloop.com). I will be sharing my lessons learned here. 

That sounds kind of like the intro to Law and Order. "These are my stories." Dun Dun!
