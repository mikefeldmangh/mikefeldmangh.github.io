Launching a site is kind of like dating. You get nervous. You only get one chance to make a first impression. This is how I felt when I first announced my web application for the first time on social media. I had put a lot of time and effort into it. It kind of felt like it was part of me. And I was putting it out there for people to use - or not use. It was going to be judged. Or ignored. Or not even noticed.

I was naive. I was hoping my point was getting across, that people would see the benefit of the application as I did and just use it. Of course I knew there was the possibility of not many people seeing it or caring. But there was also the possibility of anyone seeing it, liking it or hating it. 

Not getting much of a response is worse than any kind of response at all. You don't know if people didn't notice it, didn't bother to look or if they looked and didn't think they would need it.

Like dating, there's a fear of rejection. People may tell you your application sucks and hopefully they tell you why. It's a little different than a regular date, because with a date, you know that person met you and saw you. Launching an app might be more like online dating sites. You have your profile out there. Are you not getting responses because nobody liked your profile or because they just didn't see it? Not knowing is the worst. Did I blow it with my first impression? Did I not sell it right? Or did I just not get the word out to enough people. Will anyone pay attention to a second impression? Or will it be a first for them?

Then when someone signs up as a user or downloads your app, it's like getting a second date!
