title: A Bad Apple?
---

You may have seen that the BBC made a documentary on Apple factory conditions. Tim Cook was not very happy about it. If you haven't seen it, it's worth a look [here](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/12/19/tim-cook-offended-by-bbc/).

The documentary focuses on two problems. First, the long hours and harsh treatment of employees at various factories in China that make the iPhone. Second, the use of tin from dangerous, illegal mines.

The undercover videos and interviews from the documentary appear to show there are still problems that we should all be concerned about. But Tim Cook and others at Apple were offended. They say they are working on improvements. What is the truth? It's probably somewhere in the middle.

A quick note about where my perspective comes from: I love Apple products. The hardware and software just works. I have a Mac Mini, an iPad and an iPhone. But I don't run out to buy new products when they first come out. I had my previous Mac for 9 years. I used my first iPhone 3GS for 4 years and I plan to keep my current one at least that long. And I'm a software developer and I write web applications. At some point I probably will write apps for smart phones. But I also feel strongly about fixing human rights and environmental problems around the world.  

Given that, here are my thoughts in this. These issues are extremely complicated. I am not an expert and I don't have any extra knowledge but since I use electronics, I feel like part of the problem and want to know how I can help fix it.

This documentary was disturbing to me. I could go on and on about this topic and I did before editing this post. But it is all speculation on my part.

Does Apple deserve the criticism? Do they deserve it any more than other electronics companies?

One can hope that the factory owners in China would learn to be decent to their workers and that they would get better productivity from them if they were treated better. I would expect Apple to be encouraging this.

 

On one hand you could say the governments need to police the mining operations better. And the companies making the products need to comply with the rules Apple puts out there. How can Apple make sure everything is good if the companies just fake paperwork? But there probably is more they can do. What about the most extreme case of Apple having their own factories where they control everything. They'd have no excuse anymore. They can't just look at whether paperwork is filled out. They could be open with their policies and show videos of what it is really like, allowing outsiders to interview employees to make sure everything is going well.

There's an intersection of lots of people in China needing jobs and lots of people in the US and other countries wanting phones.


I would like to hear more from Apple in response to specific parts of the documentary. It's easy to say they could just spend more money on the problem. And they probably should but they need to answer to their stockholders.


Some people might say if I feel so strongly about this I should stop using smart phones and other technology. But that wouldn't solve anything. How many other people would do the same thing? Would you? How many people will continue to buy a new device every year? This is similar to the reason Apple says it isn't looking for tin that was mined elsewhere legally. They say they use a small amount of tin compared to other companies so it won't solve the problem. 

I don't think the answer is for us to shun the internet and technology and live like hermits. I think there is a better way to do things. If that means that we don't replace our gadgets quite so often or that we pay a little more for them or even if Apple and the other tech companies make a little less profit, I'd be fine with that.

What are your thoughts on this? Do you not give a second thought when using your iPhone knowing what people went through to make it for you? Will you just turn a blind eye and keep buying more electronics? Or will you demand more from Apple and other companies?
