title: Lesson - Do It Yourself
category: side
---

Maybe you have an idea for a side project or a business. But you don't have anyone to work with and you aren't sure you have all of the skills necessary to pull it off yourself. You could search for a partner with the right skills and hope you get along. This could be the right path for a lot of people. Or you may want to consider doing it all on your own even if you feel like you don't know what you're doing. 

This is where I was with my business idea. I had what I thought was a good idea. I approached several people about it. Everyone agreed it was a good idea but nobody had the time or the same strong interest in it as I did. I was nervous about approaching someone I didn't know at all. Would we get along? Would we agree on the vision?

I decided to just get started on developing my business. Perhaps I would find someone to help me later on. 

I already had the idea and details for a web application. I've been a software developer for a long time using mostly Java with some JavaScript and HTML, etc. thrown in there as well. But I knew there were a lot of newer languages that were better suited to web applications and would make things easier in the long run. 

In the middle of all of this I had taken a free Software as a Service (SaaS) class online through Coursera. That class used Ruby on Rails. I was hooked on the language and the framework. So I kept at it, learning Ruby and Rails in my free time by reading books, finding free resources online and attending local meetups and conferences.

It's really amazing how many resources there are out there now (mostly free) to learn a new technology compared to several years ago. The only problems are choosing which technology to learn (perhaps more on this later) and which platform to use to learn it. Now, a couple years after taking that free SaaS course, there are a huge number of places to learn a software language but most of them are not free. So you need to determine which one you like the most for the money. More on this later too.

Anyway, I learned Ruby on Rails as I went. That wasn't much of a problem. I was already pretty good at coding. But then I got to my next challenge - making the application look good.




I am trying to do as much of the work myself for several reasons.

1. I don't have the money to pay anyone else.
2. I haven't found anyone else interested enough with the right skills to help me for free.
3. I'm learning a lot more by doing it myself.

The last reason is definitely the best.


Came up with the name on my own. But I did get input from others on what they thought. I went through a LOT of ideas.

I had ideas about a logo since the very early stages. But I'm not a great artist. I think I was better when I was a kid. I thought I was stuck with the colors of red and green since it was a voting site and I wanted colors for yes and no. I found Inkscape, which is a free, open source graphics application and I learned how to use it.
