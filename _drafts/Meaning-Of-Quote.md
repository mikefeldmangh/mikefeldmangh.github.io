title: Ask Why Not
---

For me seeing the solution to a problem is as simple as the joke when going to a doctor saying it hurts when I do this. Well don't do that. Of course it's not that simple when you throw in a few hundred people let alone a few billion. 
Many people see my complaining as negative. But really my complaints are why does it need to be this way, why can't it be better? Is that negative or positive thinking? Maybe I'm an idealist? Of course different people or groups will have different ideas of what a perfect solution to a problem or a perfect world would be like.


Some people have told me I'm too negative in the past. What is the quote? I see things how they could be? I see problems in the world and I want to find out how to fix them. Maybe pointing out those problems makes me a Debbie Downer. So am I supposed to just be happy and ignore the problems and hope they go away?

So yeah there might be some posts that point out problems and might seem negative. But hopefully there will be posts that are positive too. We'll see what I come up with.
